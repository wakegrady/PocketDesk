## Introducing _**PocketDESK**_

What is _**PocketDESK**_?.

PocketDESK is a way to run the normal _Desktop GUI_ on your _PocketCHIP_ without any hassle. 

_Does the keyboard work?_  **Yes sir**

_Does the touchscreen work?_  **Yes sir**

_Can i run this next to the normal PocketHome?_ **YES SIR**


The install is super simple.

Just run

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

    git clone https://github.com/wakegrady/PocketDesk.git

    sudo ./PocketDesk/PocketDESK.sh

That is it. Do a reboot and you are good to go.




Pocket C.H.I.P can now dual boot.


Commands for setting up Pocket Desk:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/wakegrady/PocketDesk

sudo ./PocketDesk/PocketDESK.sh

For battery percentage on desktop you may only need:

cd chip-battery-status
sudo ./install.sh

You may need to clone git, I am sure it has been added as default now though!

git clone https://github.com/wakegrady/Chip-Battery-Status

## How to use!


The point of **_PocketDESK_** is that you can switch between the normal **Desktop GUI** and **PocketHome**

To do this simply log out of whatever you booted into
